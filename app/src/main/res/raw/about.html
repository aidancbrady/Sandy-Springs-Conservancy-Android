<h2>Our Mission</h2>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">     The Sandy Springs Conservancy was established in 2001 in a grass-roots effort by citizens to preserve rapidly disappearing greenspace and recreation areas in Sandy Springs. Before Sandy Springs was even a city, there was the Sandy Springs Conservancy. Now, we are a non-profit corporation recognized as a charitable service organization under the Internal Revenue Code (section 501c). We understand how parks, greenspace, and trails have key roles in shaping successful cities!</span></p>
<ul>
<li class="p2"><span class="s1">They have economic value as they increase property values</span></li>
<li class="p2"><span class="s1">They offer recreation to improve health</span></li>
<li class="p2"><span class="s1">They promote environmental protection</span></li>
<li class="p2"><span class="s1">They enhance quality of life</span></li>

<h2>Our Vision for Sandy Springs</h2>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">     Our vision is that Sandy Springs be known for its natural areas, public open spaces, trails, and parks. Our </span><span class="s2">board members</span><span class="s1"> are passionate about creating and preserving public greenspace for our community. We have a wide diversity of talent and expertise willing to work with the City and our community to educate, communicate, fund, plan, and build. We see the strong local and regional interest in walkable urban areas with great public spaces and trails, and that is exactly what we want for Sandy Springs. We think BIG!</span></p>
<p class="p1">
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">Looking to the future, we hope to see a variety of projects come to Sandy Springs in order to make this vision a reality. Here's exactly what we want for Sandy Springs:</span></p>
<ul>
<li class="p2"><span class="s1">A connectivity network that links Sandy Springs parks, neighborhoods, and city center</span>
<ul>
<li class="p2">
<p class="p1"><span class="s2">The Atlanta Beltine</span><span class="s1"> and </span><span class="s2">PATH 400</span><span class="s1"> began as transportation alternatives, but have since become engines for economic development. With City leadership and community support, we can bring PATH 400 to Sandy Springs, extending it from the I-285/GA 400 intersection, to create a connective backbone within our City and out to other Metro Atlanta destinations.</span></p>
</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li class="p2">
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">A comprehensive greenspace and trail connectivity plan as a part of the City's Comprehensive Land Use Plan and established goals for implementation</span></p>
</li>
<li class="p2">
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">A dedicated source of funds for the acquisition of greenspace in Sandy Springs</span></p>
<ul>
<li class="p2">
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">Having readily available funds and identified sources for additional funding, primarily through charitable organizations, will allow for quick and decisive action when opportunities to acquire property arise.</span></p>
</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li class="p2">
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">Identification of the "low-hanging fruit"</span></p>
<ul>
<li class="p2">
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">From FEMA properties to traffic islands and parking lots, we hope to identify potential spots of green around the City.</span></p>
</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li class="p2">
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">More public river access to the Chattahoochee</span></p>
<ul>
<li class="p2">
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">We want to capitalize on Sandy Springs' unparalleled amount (22 miles) of river frontage along the Chattahoochee River.</span></p>
